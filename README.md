# Arabic Text Classification Using Deep Learning
If we have "اللـــُغةُ الـعَـــــربية" as a model answer and 5 people to answer the question of "أجمل لغات العالم" . We would have 5 correct answers written in different ways for the same model output.

" اللعة العربية"

" اللٌغة العــــــربية"

"اللغة العربية" ...

Despite the significant progress made in Natural Language Processing, the majority of research endeavors have concentrated solely on the English language, while other languages remain relatively unexplored. Arabic, in particular, presents an imposing linguistic challenge due to its intricate grammar, vast lexicon, and diverse writing styles.Against this backdrop, this project is dedicated to the classification of Arabic text through the application of deep learning methodologies. Assembled as a comprehensive learning process, this project stives to comprehend the utilization of deep learning for text classification.

# Dataset
The dataset is a collection of Arabic texts, which covers modern Arabic language used in newspapers articles. 

# Implementation and results
The model built yielded in 75% accuracy. For future work, I plan to use pre-trained models as well as compare CNN and RNN for Arabic text classiification.
